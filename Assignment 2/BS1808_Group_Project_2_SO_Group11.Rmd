# Introduction

## Project overview

The overarching goal of this project is to optimise inventory and redesign the supply chain network of BioPharma, a chemical company. We use a combination of optimisation, heuristics and decision trees to evaluate improvements in order to make recommendations for courses of actions so that the company can cut costs and stay competitive in the global market.

In 2009, all six of BioPharma's plants maintained its capabilities for producing both Highcal and Relax; these chemicals can be shipped to any other parts of the world with additional costs attached. Furthermore, BioPharma faces import duties for all foreign goods entering a country, independent from plant origin. 

Based on the information given in tables, it is observed that

* Plants with higher fixed costs are Germany and Mexico.
* Plants with higher variable costs are Germany and Japan.
* Mexico and German plants have greater capacities.
* Some regions such as the US imported Highcal and Germany imported Relax from other plants.
* In 2009, not all plants operated at full capacity, i.e. Japan and Germany. The plants in Mexico, US, Brazil and India  operated at full capacity. 
* Import tax into Europe, Japan and US is very low.

# Wiser on Hindsight: What could have been done in 2009? (No closing down)

## The Optimisation Problem

Under the above conditions, the following optimisation problem is constructed to identify a more efficient use of resources.

__Decision Variables__

* $Q_{i,j,k}$ is the quantity of chemical $i$ to produce from plant $j$ for region $k$,
* $F_{all,j}$ is the fixed cost independent of chemical produced for plant $j$,
* $F_{i,j}$ is the fixed cost associated to producing chemical $i$ in plant $j$,
* $V_{i,j}$ is the total variable costs (raw materials and production) of producing chemical $i$ in plant $j$,
* $T_{j,k}$ is the transportation costs for shipping from plant $j$ to region $k$, and
* $I_{j,k}$ is the import tax for importing from plant $j$ to region $k$, in decimal form.

__Objective Function__

The objective function for cost is as follows:
minimise 

$\sum_{k=1}^6\sum_{j=1}^6 \sum_{i=1}^2 F_{all,j} + F_{i,j} + Q_{i,j,k}.(V_{i,j}+T_{j,k})( 1 +I_{j,k})$

__Constraints__

* Non-negative quantities $Q_{i,j,k}$
* Maximum plant capacity for producing both chemicals
* Meeting sales and demand levels 

## Results

Biopharma should have utilised its resources in the following way:

```{r show_output}
# Set scipen
options(scipen = 999)

# Get raw demand data
output <- read_excel("optim1.xlsx", sheet = "Sheet1") %>% 
            # Set column names as the first two are not present in the Excel
            set_names(c("region", 
                        "chem", 
                        "brazil", 
                        "germany", 
                        "india", 
                        "japan", 
                        "mex", 
                        "us")) %>%
            # Fill in missing values with the value from the previous row for the 
            # region names which are missing
            mutate(region = zoo::na.locf(region))

# Pretty print the output
kable(output,
      col.names = c("Sale Region", 
                    "Chemical", 
                    "Brazil", 
                    "Germany", 
                    "India", 
                    "Japan", 
                    "Mexico", 
                    "USA"),
      format.args = list(big.mark = ","),
      caption = "Table 1: Optimal Production Output in 2009")
```

The total cost for this plan is USD 1,329,314,000. Germany and US plants are serving their own regions, as shown by high quantities of Relax in the USA column and Highcal in the Germany column. Brazil, Mexico and India are producing more evenly distributed quantities and serving at least two markets. Japan is producing a very small quantity of Highcal for it's own market.

The Japanese factory should have been idled if given the opportunity because it was only producing 1mil units of Highcal for the local supply. The production of 1million units can be shifted to the plant in India, which is already producing units of Highcal for the Japanese market. This allows BioPharma to save on fixed costs, even though it is not the optimal plan. If the Japanese factory were to be idled, only the general plant fixed costs will be incurred and the cost of this new plan will be USD1,325,340,000.

The results from the optimisation corroborates the serious consideration of shutting down the Japanese plant. 

# Looking ahead: Restructuring the Global Supply Network (closing down plants)

## Optimisation under options
In restructuring its global supply network structure, BioPharma has to consider exchange rate fluctuations and the option of shutting down factories simultaneously. The options available to the network design team are:

1. Keep global network with its current structure and capabilities.
2. Limit the capability of some plants to produce only one chemical, where a plant is limited to producing only one chemical 80% of the fixed costs associated with the chemical no longer produced is saved.
3. Close down some plants, where closing down a plant eliminates all variable costs and saves 80% of annual fixed costs.

Assuming that demand in 2010 is stable and will be the same as in 2009, the cost of the new objective function (for Brazil only) is as follows:

Minimise 

$Cost = (0.8B_0+0.2).F_{all,Brazil}$
$+(0.8B_1+0.2).F_{Brazil,Highcal}+\sum_{k=1}^6 Q_{Highcal,Brazil,k}.(V_{Highcal,Brazil}+T_{Brazil,k}).(1 +I_{Brazil,k})$
$+(0.8B_2+0.2).F_{Brazil,Relax}+\sum_{k=1}^6 Q_{Relax,Brazil,k}.(V_{Relax,Brazil}+T_{Brazil,k}).( 1 +I_{Brazil,k})$

$+... costs for 6 other plants$



where

* $B_0$ is the switch for closing or opening the entire Brazil factory
* $B_1$ is the switch for controlling the fixed costs for Highcal 
* $B_2$ is the switch for controlling the fixed costs for Relax 
* $E_0, E_1, E_2, I_0, I_1, I_2$ would similarly, be switches for Europe, India etc.. if the obj funct is extended. There are 3x6=18 switches in all.

and the additional constraints would be:

* $B_0 \geq B_1$, so that no Highcal is produced when the factory is shut
* $B_0 \geq B_2$, so that no Relax is produced when the factory is shut
* $MB_1 \geq \sum_{k=1}^6 Q_{Highcal,Brazil,k}$, so that no highcal is produced when the facilities are absent.
* $MB_2 \geq \sum_{k=1}^6 Q_{Relax,Brazil,k}$, so that no Relax is produced when the facilities are absent.

## Results

```{r show_output2}
# Get raw demand data
output2 <- read_excel("optim1.xlsx", sheet = "Sheet2") %>% 
            # Set column names as the first two are not present in the Excel

                        "us")) %>%
            # Fill in missing values with the value from the previous row for the 
            # region names which are missing
            mutate(region = zoo::na.locf(region))

      col.names = c("Sale Region",

                    "Germany", 
                    "India", 
                    "Japan", 
                    "Mexico", 
                    "USA"),
      format.args = list(big.mark = ","),
      caption = "Table 2: Optimal Production Output with new Supply Network Design for 2010")

```

The new optimised cost after completely shuting down the Japanese plant, cutting Relax facilities in Germany, and Highcal facilities in US is: USD 1,293,383,000, USD 35,931,000 less than the cost without closing down plants. This may possibly be attributed to the high fixed costs and low capacity of 10 million units incurred by the Japanese plant. Unless the high costs are justified by the plant being a technological leader or being able to bring other external benefits in the long term to BioPharma the Japanese plant can be shut and the production can be transferred to other plants. As a result, the Japanese market's demand for Highcal will be fulfilled by Brazil, Germany and India and the market demand for Relax by India. From Figure 6-18 of the question sheet, it is observed that Japan was already importing chemicals from other plants in 2009 - as its total demand of 15mil units of Highcal and Relax exceeds its capacity of 10mil units. Furthermore, the plant was only producing a meagre 2mil units with full operational costs. 

It is suggested that Germany continue to produce only Highcal in the next year, and an extra million kilograms for Japan and million for US. In addition, the USA will only produce Relax, and export that to Europe whilst replacing US made Relax product wiht Mexican Relax. Brazil, Mexico, India, and the US will operate at full capacity with minor changes in the quantities of the chemicals. 

## Exchange Rates

The costs of doing business from a plant can be significantly lower due to weakened exchange rates. BioPharma as an international business will be greatly affected by these fluctuations and can opt to redistribute production to different plants based on exchange rates. The following analysis is based on the assumption that BioPharma is a US company and is primarily interested in profits in US dollars as opposed to other currencies.

A decision tree is used to assess the risk of these fluctuations and to calculate the expected return of each plant. Assuming that the exchange rates in 2010 can fall or rise to any of the rates from 2004 to 2009 with equal probability, the following decision tree with expected costs is constructed: 

```{r show_tree, out.width = 600, out.height= 600, fig.retina = NULL, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Figure 1: Decision Tree"}

include_graphics("./Supply Chain Decision Tree/Supply Chain Decision Tree.001.jpeg")

```

### Analysis

Exchange rates costs are expected to increase significantly at $30mil from Mexico and $12mil from India, and decrease $14mil from Brazil and $12mil from Germany. BioPharma faces a greater problem of rising costs from FX. In response, BioPharma can opt to shift Highcal production to Germany as it is not operating at full capacity. More specifically, Highcal exports to US can be managed by Germany. If necessary and if it becomes more cost effective due to weakening of exchange rates from Europe, Germany could open its Relax production capabilities to serve the European market for Relax. As for Brazil, it exports 1mil kg of Relax to Europe and 3mil kg of Highcal to Japan. Similarly, such productions can be shifted to other plants. 

This situation shows that the German plant's unused capactiy may not be as ineffective. The German plant gives BioPharma the flexibility to cope with unexpected economic environments, while maintaining its technological advancements.

Alternatively, these figures for the expected costs for each plant can be reintroduced into the optimisation problem in order to reestimate the supply chain network. BioPharma can also hedge against exchange rate risks through financial intermediaries.

#Scenario: Expansion Options

## The Optimisation Problem

In considering such options, this changes the optimisation by adding: 

1. Additional binary variables of AB ($\textbf{A}$dditional capacity for $\textbf{B}$razil),  $AG$,  $AI$,  $AJ$,  $AM$ and  $AU$ to function as switches to allocate a mill kg of capacity for one factory:
2. Constraint where additional capacity can only be added to one plant: $AB+AG+AI+AJ+AM+AU
<=1$

## Results

```{r show_output3}
# Get raw demand data
output3 <- read_excel("optim1.xlsx", sheet = "Sheet3") %>% 
            # Set column names as the first two are not present in the Excel
            set_names(c("region", 
                        "chem", 
                        "brazil", 
                        "germany", 
                        "india", 
                        "japan", 
                        "mex", 
                        "us")) %>%
            # Fill in missing values with the value from the previous row for the 
            # region names which are missing
            mutate(region = zoo::na.locf(region))

# Pretty print the output
kable(output3,
      col.names = c("Region", 
                    "Chemical", 
                    "Brazil", 
                    "Germany", 
                    "India", 
                    "Japan", 
                    "Mexico", 
                    "USA"),
      format.args = list(big.mark = ","),
      caption = "Table 3: Optimal Production Output with new Supply Network Design for 2010 with additional capacity")

```

The greatest savings to cost occurs when the plant expanded is India, with a minimum cost of USD 1,293,309,000. Indian production of Highcal increases by the full  1mill kg units which is set to Japan, replacing the 1 mill Highcal units from Germany to Japan. The previous minimum cost with shutting down of plants was USD 1,293,383,000, hence USD 74K savings occurs from this USD 3mill investment. From the financial side the increase in capacity should not be undertaken.

# Scenario: A reduction of duties

## Results

Under the assumption that all import tariffs are removed, the new costs for BioPharma will be at USD 1,267,200,000, which is USD 26,183,000 less than a base senario with shutting plants (or USD 62,114,000 less than a senario without shutting plants). This emphasises that import tariffs heavily affects the costs of production and distribution of the chemicals to different regions. 

```{r show_output4}
# Get raw demand data
output4 <- read_excel("optim1.xlsx", sheet = "Sheet4") %>% 
            # Set column names as the first two are not present in the Excel
            set_names(c("region", 
                        "chem", 
                        "brazil", 
                        "germany", 
                        "india", 
                        "japan", 
                        "mex", 
                        "us")) %>%
            # Fill in missing values with the value from the previous row for the 
            # region names which are missing
            mutate(region = zoo::na.locf(region))

# Pretty print the output
kable(output4,
      col.names = c("Region", 
                    "Chemical", 
                    "Brazil", 
                    "Germany", 
                    "India", 
                    "Japan", 
                    "Mexico", 
                    "USA"),
      format.args = list(big.mark = ","),
      caption = "Table 4: Optimal Production Output for 2010 without import tariffs")

```

Without import tariffs, optimal production quantity will depend more heavily on actual costs of production and transportation. Brazil, India, Mexico, and the USA work at full capacity, as they are cheapest to produce in. Further, whilst we see Germany and the US continuing to stick to production of goods in which they have a comparative advantage in  (Germany Highcal, USA Relax); nearly all other plants - with the exception of Brazil - start to specialise in producing one chemical only, and each plant producing for a region outside of its own (i.e. trade). From an Economist's point of view this lowering of tariffs represents a lessening of red tape, and the model of the economy is tending towards an equilibrium where countries specalise in producing goods in which they have a comparitive advantage in (Riccardo), i.e. India and USA in Relax, Mexico and Germny in Highcal. From a more objective point of view, the lowering of tariffs have resulted in more plants being allowed to close down, resulting in more savings of fixed costs.

# Not 100% yield
Yield (Throughput Yield in this case) is defined as manufacturing output per unit raw material input over a particular time period. A 100% yield would mean a fully efficient manufacturing process. A reduction in yield, say to 90%, would mean that more materials would be required in order to maintain the same output as with 100% yield, hence the raw material and production costs for each chemical at each plant would be divided by 0.9.

Also since product is wasted, we can no longer assume that the production capacity at each plant is the same, the fall in yield also materialises as a reduction in production capacity by multiplying each plant’s capacity by 0.9.


# What other factors to be considered when making your recommendations?
When making the recommendations on production, a number of other factors might also need to be accounted for as they all have some effect on production capacity and demand:

Sales projections: Similar to the projected 10% increase in demand from Asia W/O Japan in the case, the company’s sales team might have uncovered other markets (the rest of the BRIC’s for example), industries, or initiatives by current clients which could signal an increase in demand, and this should normally be taken into account to avoid potential undersupply due to underproduction. It can also indicate potential reduction in demand.

Competition: Increased competition (new entrants or alternative products) could reduce demand and therefore should be accounted for in forecasts. Likewise, the demise of a competitor especially when due to singular reasons, could sign a potential increase in demand from its previous clients.

Relative Inflation/Exchange rates: Inflation could have an effect on where to manufacture and supply to. All else being equal, countries which have a higher level of inflation would ideally be better manufacturing bases as their depreciating currency value would result in their exports becoming cheaper. It would also mean imports would become more costly for them, and would make it preferable to source goods locally and manufacture locally. Likewise, countries with relatively low interest rates would be more beneficial purchasers as they would prefer lower prices from the cheaper countries, possess a more stable currency and be able to pay more for the same goods.

Political turmoil/Natural Disasters: Unprecedented disasters in different countries/locations could adversely affect supply chains, resulting on consequences across the chain. Things like tornadoes, e.t.c. could drastically reduce production capacity, while political turmoil could also result in sanctions, civil wars, and reduce demand in the same way. Biopharma should therefore consider this, either through sourcing from multiple suppliers and/or slowly reducing dependency on potentially unstable countries.

Oil prices: Oil prices are a major component of supply chain costs. Being the major factor in virtually all means of transportation, changing oil prices would have an effect on freight transportation costs for Biopharma and their suppliers, and a possible subsequent effect on demand from oil producing countries.
